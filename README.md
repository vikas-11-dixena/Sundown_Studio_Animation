Project Description:-
The project represents a tranquil sunset scene with animated and interactive elements like a glowing sun, gently moving clouds, swaying trees, and scroll-triggered animations. 
Users can scroll through the studio webpage and experience animations that bring the scene to life.

Core features :- 
1> HTML Structure :- i> Defines the layout of the page with elements for the sun, clouds, trees, and background layers.
                    ii> Includes sections for different stages of the sundown scene (e.g., dusk to night).
                    iii> Uses semantic tags like <section>, <header>, and <footer> for structure.

2> CSS Styling :- i> layered background :- Uses gradients to create a smooth transition from a bright orange sunset to a dark, starry night.
                 ii> Element Styling :- Styles for the sun, clouds, trees, and other elements are created using shapes (border-radius for circular elements) and gradients.

3> CSS Animation :- i> Movement :- The sun transitions downwards, fading into the horizon.
                  ii> clouds :- Slow horizontal motion across the screen with a slight easing effect.
                  iii> Trees :- Subtle swaying effect to mimic wind.
                  iv> Keyframe animations define smooth transitions for all elements.

4> Javascript functionality :- i> Adds interactivity to the project, such as user-triggered actions (e.g., clicking on elements for specific effects).
                              ii> Synchronizes animations with the user's scrolling behavior using Locomotive Scroll.

5> Locomotive Scroll JS Integration :- i> Implements a parallax effect for depth perception.
                                      ii> Smooth scroll experience with inertia.
                                      iii> Scroll-triggered animations (e.g., the sun descending as the user scrolls, clouds fading as night falls).
                                      iv> Allows dynamic control over element visibility and transformations.


User Experience :-
                   i> Visual Appeal :-
                                       a> The glowing sun and gradient backgrounds provide a peaceful aesthetic.
                                       b>  Dynamic animations create an engaging and lifelike sundown environment.
                  ii> Interactive Elements :-
                                             a> Scroll-triggered animations guide the user through different stages of sundown.
                                             b>  Mouse hover effects (e.g., hovering over clouds to speed them up or clicking the sun to initiate a special effect).
